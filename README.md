Credits
==========
This code was forked from a Udacity course.  The only files that were modified were:
 - app.js
 - readme.md (this file)
 - maybe 1 line in the engine.js

 If you wish to fork or download this version, feel free.  If you need to contact me,
 I can be reached at levi@dvdmon.com.

Instructions
==============

Download all the files in this repository.

Open the index.html file in a browser and the game will start to play.

The object of the game is to move the player (middle bottom of the screen)
from the grass to the water, without touching any of the bugs going across
the screen.  

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player in any direction.

Each time you move the player to the water without colliding with a bug you
are awarded with a star.  When you have filled the entire water area with
stars, you're done!

For Developers
================

The game play in this app is pretty basic.  Some ideas for items that could
be expanded upon:
- Numerical scoring
- Diferent types of rewards (gems in addition to stars, etc.).
- Saving of high scores.
- Lives of the player being used up and ending the game.
